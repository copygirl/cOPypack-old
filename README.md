# c[OP]ypack Modpack

This is the repository of a modpack for the obsidian group. It contains a
couple of "overpowered" mods and is used as a test bed for the Pack[OP]dater.
Changes made to the master branch of the repository will cause the main server
to grab the changes and restart.

Pull requests should be made to the development branch. Consider making
multiple small pull requests for mod additions and major config changes and use
the comment feature on GitHub to discuss the changes.
